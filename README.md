# TED-Talk-Analysis
Data Analysis project on TED Talks 

This project consists of analysing a dataset containing TED Talks of various speakers. 
By doing this project I found out:
1. Most famous speaker based on views, likes and no. of ted talks.
2. How many ted talks happen monthly and yearly.
3. Finding ted talks of a particular author or a particular tag.
